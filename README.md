#💫 About Me
- 🔭 Currently Building: Reproducible AI workflows with LangChain and Gemini in Colab — modular pipelines, clean dependency management, and scalable design.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Open to Collaborate On:Open-source contributions (and starter issues) in TensorFlow & Matplotlib, focusing on explainability, visualization, and developer experience.
- 🤝 Seeking Help With: Optimizing document processing pipelines and enhancing vector store integration for large‑scale semantic search.
- 🌱 Actively Learning: Advanced debugging strategies, secure API key management, and deployment techniques using GCP and Streamlit.
- 💬 Ask Me About: Python, C++, reproducible Colab setups, backend architecture, and deploying AI tools with explainability.
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I turn workflow bottlenecks into automation hacks — and enjoy polishing GitHub READMEs for recruiter‑readiness.
