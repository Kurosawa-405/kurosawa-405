# Hi 👋 I'm Kurosawa-405

I'm an ML student focused on building models and production-ready ML services. I work primarily with Python and use cloud platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud (GCP) to train, deploy, and scale models.

- 🔭 Currently: learning advanced ML systems and model deployment patterns  
- 🌱 Focus: machine learning, MLOps, model evaluation, and scalable inference  
- 🧰 Tech & tools: Python · NumPy · pandas · scikit-learn · PyTorch · TensorFlow · Docker · AWS · Google Cloud Platform (GCP) · MLflow · Git

## Live dashboard

The dashboard below is regenerated regularly (daily, on push, and on-demand) and shows:
- top languages,
- a realistic commits-per-day graph (last 90 days),
- a contributions sparkline (extracted from GitHub contributions),
- recent commits,
- build/test/coverage badges.

It is generated by a GitHub Action and committed into `assets/dashboard.svg`.

How it works & what I included
1. Workflow: `.github/workflows/generate-dashboard.yml` — runs daily, on push, and manually; runs the generator and commits `assets/dashboard.svg`.
2. Generator: `scripts/generate_dashboard.py` — fetches repos, public events, computes top languages, builds a 90-day commit-per-day bar chart, extracts the GitHub contributions SVG for a sparkline, and assembles a single `assets/dashboard.svg`.
3. Badges: README contains badges via shields.io. Once you add CI workflows (e.g., `ci.yml`), the build badge will populate automatically.
4. No heavy plotting libraries — generator produces pure SVG so the Action is lean.

Next steps for you
- Replace personal placeholders (email, project links).
- Commit these files to your profile repo `Kurosawa-405/Kurosawa-405` and push.
- Run the workflow in Actions > "Generate profile dashboard" or wait for the scheduled run.
- If you want me to open a PR for you, provide repository owner access or grant me permission to push (I cannot push from here).
